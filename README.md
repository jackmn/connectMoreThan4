# All of the files need to exist in the same folder as per the structure of the project.
# The files that need to be run are the ServerThread main as this handles the threads for the clients on behalf of the while starting a different server thread for each client. The server threads use a global instance of the gameState class which holds the details of the game for the different clients.
# After this is running, two instances of the client main should be run to represent each of the players. After these are running the rest of the information needed should be prompted by the terminal as there is no graphical interface for this code.
#Testing files can be run as long as they are in the same folder as per the set up of the project.
